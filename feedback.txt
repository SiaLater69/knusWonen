When Looking at the design I saw a few things that were wrong.
Firstly the espect ratio(width) of the design stretches farther than the recommended desin width which is 1440px
this offsets some elements when the screen is resized.
It would also be better if the height of the design was more consistant.
when the initial design was being made not enough thought came into how the elements would line up on mobile devices
